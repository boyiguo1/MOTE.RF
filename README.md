# MOTE.RF

This is a newer implementation of the MOTE RF algorithm (to be published) in C++ for speedy computation purpose.

Previous version was implemented with R (available at https://github.com/boyiguo1/MOTTE.RF).

This new version will replace the old version once it is finished. 

The goal of MOTE RF is to model estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects for multivariate outcomes.
